**Spam Email Detection**:
   - **Objective**: The objective is to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham).
   - **Dataset**: You can use datasets like the Enron Spam dataset, which contains labeled examples of spam and ham emails.
   - **Approach**: Start by preprocessing the email text data, similar to sentiment analysis, by tokenizing, removing stopwords, etc. Then, convert the text into numerical features using techniques like bag-of-words or TF-IDF. Choose a classification algorithm like Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression and train the model on the labeled data. Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate test dataset.
